                        I was applied to join PRS when I was form 2 in secondary school. Soon, I passed the interview 
                        and started an 8-month training course. During the training, the teacher taught us a lot about 
                        counseling and communication skills. I had learned about the mission and vision of PRS
                        throughout the course. The 8-month training actually passed quickly. I also met many friends
                        during the training, and I had a good relationship with the teacher. After the training, the 
                        seniors had given a test to us. Fortunately, I passed the test and will soon put on a purple 
                        school uniform when I was form 3 in the next year to become a part of the PRS.

                        One day in December of the same year, the seniors held a tie handover ceremony for us. A 
                        purple school uniform with a tie specially made by the school for us is a symbol of our PRS. 
                        On that day, my partners and I changed into the school uniforms we had bought before and 
                        came to the auditorium of the school. We are all very excited, because this is the first time 
                        we have put on the purple school uniform that we have long admired, and we are ready to 
                        take our own tie from the teacher. After the teacher's speech, the seniors began to take turns 
                        calling our name to take the tie. In the process of waiting, we all made fun of each other 
                        because we had never seen each other wearing purple school uniforms. Soon after, the 
                        senior called my name. I walked on stage with tension and excitement. In fact, I think it is 
                        more embarrassing, because everyone is watching me with a teasing look under the stage.

                        When everyone got the tie, the seniors began to teach us how to wear the tie properly. We all 
                        listened carefully in the under the stage and followed the instructions given by the seniors to 
                        wear the tie step by step. There are some people among us still don't understand how to wear 
                        the tie. So, the seniors patiently taught him personally. For me, although I was also still not 
                        really understand the step, I had cooperated with my friends to find out and correct each
                        other's steps to wear the tie. In the end, everyone had learned all the steps to wear the tie 
                        smoothly.

                        This was a very meaningful day because I finally became a part of PRS on this day. After becoming 
                        a PRS, I want to use my abilities to help my friends around me, the teacher and also myself.
